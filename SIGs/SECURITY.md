# The Security Special Interest Group (SIG)
This readme contains some high level information on the OpenAPI Initiative special interest group for security.

- [slack](https://open-api.slack.com/archives/C97Q5AQ9J)

Calls of the SIG security are currently on pause. The group will resume work in Q4. Details for the calls will be shared then.

## Charter / Motivation / Mission
The Security SIG aims to extend the current security schemes set and allow for an extensible framework to describe credentials and where to provide them. A proposal was created that is visible here: https://github.com/OAI/sig-security/blob/main/2021-05-19-New-Security-Definitions.md
We are working on making sure the proposal works well for current security schemes (Basic Auth, APIKey, OAuth, etc.) and future ones. In particular, the following proposals were made by the RAR and GNAP groups.
https://github.com/OAI/sig-security/issues/7
https://github.com/OAI/sig-security/issues/8
https://github.com/OAI/sig-security/issues/9
Additionally, several lines of works are possible:
- Description of JWTs extensions for the purpose of validation by toolings
- Description of signed/encrypted payloads and headers, in particular for the banking industry

## Future Plans
Redefine the security schemes section of the OpenAPI specification for the next major version.
