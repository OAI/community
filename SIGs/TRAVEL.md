# The Travel Special Interest Group (SIG)

This readme contains some high level information on the OpenAPI Initiative special interest group for the travel industry.

This effort will include working with various established travel standards and trade association bodies using the Open Travel Alliance as a coordination point. Open Travel will moderate the various needs of sectors such as (but not limited to) air, hotel, car, cruise, rail, tours, distribution channels, etc. with a focus on enabling interoperability across the sectors. The standards bodies and trade associations will lead on what functionality is needed by their members.

## Charter / Motivation / Mission
The Travel SIG will compile and present a collective representation of the API behaviors required by the travel industry documented in the form of use cases and workflows. The Travel SIG will work with other OAI SIGs on how best to support the documented use cases and workflows. The intent here is to avoid duplication of SIG efforts and have the Travel SIG focus on what is needed and work with other SIGs on how to meet that need.

## Current Working Scope
The team is working on a means to document in a developer friendly way common travel API workflows. This will feed into the sig-workflow effort but also intended to provide a more immediate solution to the industry as a reference implementation. Currently we are looking at using a popular mock management tool as a means to show workflow use cases in action.

## Future Plans
Look at how to better integrate OpenTravel tools which build off a common business object model and produce OAS 3.0 with commonly used API tooling. This will make is easier to pull sample APIs from the common model and feed them into mocks to test various aspects of the OAS.
