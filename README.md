You can find documentation about the latest version of the OpenAPI Specification (OAS) [here](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html). All versions of the OpenAPI Spec can be found on the OAI GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/releases).

## Who owns the OpenAPI Spec?
The OpenAPI Spec is an open-source, community maintained specification, lead by a group of [maintainers](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md) called the Technical Steering Committee. Further details about the governance strucutre can be found [here](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md).
