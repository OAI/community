## What is the OpenAPI Initiative
The OpenAPI Initiative (OAI) was created by a consortium of forward-looking industry experts who recognize the immense value of standardizing on how APIs are described. As an open governance structure under the Linux Foundation, the OAI is focused on creating, evolving and promoting a vendor neutral description format.

## How do I find the latest version of the spec?
You can find documentation about the latest version of the OpenAPI Specification (OAS) [here](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html). All versions of the OpenAPI Spec can be found on the OAI GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/releases).

## Who owns the OpenAPI Spec?
The OpenAPI Spec is an open-source, community maintained specification, lead by a group of [maintainers](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md) called the Technical Steering Committee. Further details about the governance strucutre can be found [here](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md). The OAI actively, openly, and enthusiastically seeks contributions from members of the OAI community at large.
