# Welcome to the OpenAPI Initiative's Community Repo!

This repo is intended to be the hub for engagement with the OpenAPI Initiative and provide guidance for community members - that's you! - on the best ways to strengthen, enhance and grow the OpenAPI Spec (OAS) ecosystem. Whether you are brand new to APIs or a long-in-the-tooth practitioner we are excited for you to be here.

# FAQ's
## What is the OpenAPI Initiative
The OpenAPI Initiative (OAI) was created by a consortium of forward-looking industry experts who recognize the immense value of standardizing on how APIs are described. As an open governance structure under the Linux Foundation, the OAI is focused on creating, evolving and promoting a vendor neutral description format.

## How do I find the latest version of the spec?
You can find documentation about the latest version of the OpenAPI Specification (OAS) [here](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html). All versions of the OpenAPI Spec can be found on the OAI GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/releases).

## Who owns the OpenAPI Spec?
The OpenAPI Spec is an open-source, community maintained specification, lead by a group of [maintainers](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md) called the Technical Steering Committee. Further details about the governance structure can be found [here](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md). The OAI actively, openly, and enthusiastically seeks contributions from members of the OAI community at large. See how to participate in our technical discussions [here](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification#participation).

## Does the OAI have dedicated working groups?
Members of OpenAPI have formed a variety of special interest groups (SIGs) that work as a group to address a defined set of issues or objectives. There are two basic types of SIGs, technical and industry focused. The technical SIGs focus on a specific feature like overlays. The results of these SIGs may end up as an update to the OAS or a separate guideline or specification. The industry SIGs look at a broader scope of how the OAS applies to an industry segment. This facilitates two way communication. Inbound to OAI what are the challenges an industry segment is facing in the form of real world use cases to determine if the OAS holds up. Gaps may become a focus of a technical SIG. Outbound the SIGs communicate to an industry segment how the OAS meets their needs which may include reference implementations. The value of both directions of this communication is providing the relevancy of the OAS to address the challenges of an industry.

More information on the SIGs can be found [here](./SPECIAL_INTEREST_GROUPS.md)
